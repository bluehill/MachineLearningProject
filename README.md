MachineLearningProject
======================

This is a Data Science Specialization Coursera project. 

The project aim is to use machine learning techniques to predict if gym exercises are done correctly or not. 

The rmd files contain all R code to access and process data (split into training and testing, as well as processing)

The figure folder contains an old dendrogram from an rpart of the procedure that had poor predictive power. 

The .html file should have all the script and explanations for peer reviewed grading. 

Have a nice day, don't forget to get outside and enjoy some sunshine now and then :)
